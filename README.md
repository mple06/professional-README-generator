# PROFESSIONAL README

## Description

I built a backend professional README.md application to be easily used by anyone. Afterall, a README is one of the first thing developer will look at so you want to ensure it is polished and stands out.

    - As a new developer, I didn't really used README's at first. But now that I understand the importance of it, I want to make sure I spend time creating a clean,        professional README.
    - I hope it will make it easier and clearer for new developers coming into the field.
